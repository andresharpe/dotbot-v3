## [4.0.4] - 2026-08-27

### Added
- **`dotbot doctor` WORKSPACE TRACKING section** reports any tracked `.bot/` tree hidden by an ignore rule, naming the rule responsible (`file:line:pattern`) so the offending entry can be found. Covers `.bot/workspace/tasks`, `.bot/workspace/decisions`, `.bot/content`, `.bot/hooks` and `.bot/settings`. Run from a task worktree it resolves back to the main repository via `git rev-parse --git-common-dir`, so it reports identically from either checkout.
- **`Start-DotbotRuntimeDetached`** in `Dotbot.Runtime` — brings the per-project runtime up in a process of its own by spawning `dotbot serve` as a child and waiting for `.control/runtime.json`, which `Start-DotbotRuntime` writes only once the listener is accepting. `Start-DotbotRuntime` hosts the listener in-process and records its own `$PID`, so it cannot serve a CLI that exits immediately after spawning a detached runner. The result carries no `listener` handle, so a caller can never tear down a runtime it does not own.

### Changed
- **`dotbot run <workflow>` and `dotbot tasks run` now start the runtime themselves** when none is alive, instead of only doing so under `--watch`. `--no-auto-runtime` is the opt-out on both paths and now refuses synchronously with exit 1. `--watch` still hosts its runtime in-process and tears it down on exit; the runtime auto-started for a detached run deliberately outlives the command (`dotbot runtime-status` reports its PID). For `dotbot run` the runtime is settled *before* `Initialize-WorkflowRun`, so a runtime that cannot start leaves no run, no tasks and no integration branch behind.
- **`dotbot tasks run` propagates its exit code** through `bin/dotbot.ps1`, matching `dotbot run` / `dotbot workflow run` / `dotbot doctor`. `exit` inside a `&`-invoked script only ends that script, so the dispatcher kept running past the failure; the code still reached the shell because nothing after the dispatch `switch` resets `$LASTEXITCODE`, but the guard now halts at the failure point instead of relying on that.

### Fixed
- **The test suite passes again (#686).** `Test-ProcessDispatch.ps1` extracted `Get-WorkflowRunInvocation` from `bin/dotbot.ps1` by AST and dot-sourced it alone, but that function now calls the `ConvertTo-DotbotParameterName` helper defined elsewhere in the same file, so the test file died mid-run — taking the four `--poll-interval-ms` assertions and the whole `CLI RUNTIME PRECONDITION` section (the regression guard for #682) with it. Neither change failed on its own; only merging them did. Both functions are extracted now, and an assertion on the extraction count replaces the silent `if` so a future breakage fails loudly instead of skipping. `tests/Run-Tests.ps1` also tees each child's output and reports a file that exits non-zero **without** printing a `Summary:` line as a distinct crash, which is how this went unnoticed.
- **Runtime auto-start no longer trusts a recorded PID on its own (#686).** `Test-RuntimeAlive` only checked that *some* process held the PID in `.bot/.control/runtime.json`, so a stale connection file — the normal state after any non-graceful exit, since only `Stop-DotbotRuntime` removes it — made `dotbot run` print `Using existing headless runtime.` and then do nothing, leaving the task `needs-input` with "connection refused". It now also requires the process to be a PowerShell host, matching the guards in `bin/dotbot.ps1` and `src/ui/server.ps1`, and `Start-DotbotRuntimeDetached` probes the recorded URL before attaching (any HTTP response counts, 401 included) and treats a non-serving runtime as a stale file to replace.
- **Auto-started runtimes no longer leak (#686).** Concurrent cold starts raced through a bare check-then-start and spawned two hosts, one orphaned forever; the readiness timeout threw without killing the child it had just spawned, which then wrote its own connection file; and `Stop-DotbotRuntime` removed whatever `runtime.json` was on disk without comparing its PID, making a *healthy* runtime undiscoverable and manufacturing the stale-file state above. The start path is now serialised on a system-wide named mutex keyed on the bot root, the timeout kills its child from a `finally`, and the connection file is removed only when it names the process doing the stopping. `dotbot runtime stop` reads the connection file, stops that PID and clears the file — previously nothing could stop a runtime that had no console to close.
- **A run no longer moves you off your own branch (#686).** The integration branch is cut from the configured base (`main`/`master` unless `git.base_branch` says otherwise) and the run ended with `git checkout <base>`, so starting a run from a feature branch silently built on `main` *and* left the checkout there. The run now records the branch it started on and returns to it, and warns before creating the integration branch when that branch is not the configured base — naming both and the setting that changes it. `git.base_branch` is documented in `dotbot help` and the README; `Resolve-MainBranch` still never reads HEAD (#317).
- **Paths containing `[` or `]` no longer break dotbot (#686).** PowerShell reads `[...]` in `-Path` as a character class, so in a directory such as `bracket[v2]` every composed probe missed: `Get-DotbotProjectBotPath` walked past the project and returned the temp-directory fallback — a legitimate value for "not in a project", which is why it was silent — and `dotbot init` reported "Current directory is not a git repository" for a repo that was one, then "Failed to initialize git repository" after `git init` had succeeded. Every `Test-Path (Join-Path …)` in `src/`, `bin/` and `content/` now passes `-LiteralPath`, as do the content reads and writes and the stale-worktree cleanup that `dotbot init` and `New-TaskWorktree` depend on (`Remove-Item -Path` silently no-ops on such a path rather than failing). A new Layer 1 gate, `tests/Test-NoWildcardPaths.ps1`, keeps the composed-probe class at zero with no allowlist, and a Layer 2 test drives `dotbot init` and `New-TaskWorktree` through a real `bracket[v2]` fixture. The worktree sanity check also no longer blames git for dotbot's own probe.
- **`dotbot tasks run --no-auto-runtime` binds (#686).** `tasks-run.ps1` took no parameters, so the flag the CHANGELOG advertised on both auto-start paths raised a parameter-binding error indistinguishable from a typo. It now refuses with the same message and exit code as `dotbot run --no-auto-runtime`, and both paths are covered by tests.
- **`dotbot workflow list` rejects unknown flags (#686).** It was the last `src/cli` script that was neither `[CmdletBinding()]` nor implicitly advanced, so `dotbot workflow list --json` exited 0 with decorated text that is not JSON, and any flag at all was silently dropped. `--json` is documented in `dotbot help` as supported on `status` only.
- **`dotbot studio` no longer dirties the framework checkout (#686).** It writes `.studio-port` at the root of `DOTBOT_HOME`, which no `.gitignore` at that level covered — the per-project template ignores `runtime/.studio-port`, a different path.
- **A failed task no longer discards the commits the agent already made (#683).** All three task-failure paths in `Invoke-WorkflowProcess.ps1` removed the worktree *and* force-deleted the task branch, leaving committed work reachable only as a dangling git object that the next `git gc` destroys. Executor-dispatch failure, provider/prompt failure, and an agent calling `task_set_status(failed)` (which lands in the terminal-state arm, since there is no `failed/` bucket for `Get-TaskTerminalState`) now all remove only the worktree and report the preserved branch plus its tip SHA (`Branch task/… preserved at <sha> — inspect with: git log task/…`). The genuinely-abandoned terminal states (`skipped`/`cancelled`/`split`) still delete the branch, and uncommitted worktree changes are still discarded.
- **A run no longer leaves an empty, unreapable `workflow/*` integration branch (#683).** The integration branch was created before any task ran and pushed with `-u` unconditionally, so a run whose output is gitignored (or which completed zero tasks) published a branch whose PR would be empty — and pushing it is exactly what made `dotbot prune-branches` skip it by default. Run completion now counts `rev-list --count <base>..<integration>` and, when it is zero, skips the push and deletes the branch (with the safe `-d`) after restoring the base checkout — unless a retained worktree still records it as its `base_branch`, in which case it is kept locally so a parked or escalated task can still merge into it. Branches that carry commits are pushed and announced exactly as before.
- **`dotbot prune-branches` candidate list** no longer glues the branch name to the timestamp, and renders the date culture-invariantly (#683).
- **Kebab-case CLI flags bind again (#684).** `bin/dotbot.ps1` used the raw flag text as the splat key, so every hyphenated flag raised a `ParameterBindingException` from inside the dispatcher: `--older-than`, `--poll-interval-ms`, `--bot-root`, `--mothership-api-key`, `--no-auto-runtime` and `--no-runtime` all failed. A single `ConvertTo-DotbotParameterName` helper now normalises `--older-than` → `OlderThan` at the five places the dispatcher derives a splat key. Unhyphenated flags keep their existing key, and `--mothership-key` keeps working through a compatibility alias on `serve.ps1`.
- **`dotbot doctor` no longer reports PASS for a directory it never scanned (#684).** `doctor.ps1` was a *simple* script, so `--bot-root <path>` landed in `$args` and was silently dropped. It, `tasks-run.ps1` and `tasks-stop.ps1` are now advanced scripts that reject unknown flags, and `dotbot tasks run` passes its flags through instead of discarding them.
- **Every CLI error path now exits non-zero (#684).** Unknown verb, missing required argument, parameter-binding failure and `ValidateSet`/`ValidateRange` violations all exited 0, so no CI step could detect a mistyped dotbot command. Binding and validation failures are reported through the theme helpers instead of a raw PowerShell stack frame, the usage / not-found paths for `run`, `workflow`, `tasks`, `install`, `registry`, `init`, `go`, `studio` and `resume` exit 1, and `init`, `workflow`, `registry`, `install`, `tasks`, `status`, `serve`, `prune-branches` and `studio` now propagate their child script's exit code (previously only `doctor` and a valid `run` did, so `dotbot init` returned 0 from a non-git directory). `logs` and `runtime-status` propagate too, so the 0/1/2 contract `runtime-status.ps1` documents is reachable from a shell; `dotbot logs` on a project with no `activity.jsonl` now exits 0, because an empty log is a display state rather than a failure. `dotbot install skill <name> --unknown-flag` is also rejected rather than dropped, because the dispatcher's unknown-flag fall-through reached only the runtime splat. `dotbot help` still exits 0.
- **`dotbot help` matches reality (#684):** the non-existent `install content` is replaced by the real `install skill` spelling, `workflow scaffold` is documented, and the `workflow` usage line advertises `--force` rather than `--Force`.
- **`dotbot studio` is reachable again (#684).** The verb resolved `<DOTBOT_HOME>/studio-ui`, but the studio moved to `src/studio-ui/` in v4; the studio's own `server.ps1` and `go.ps1` also still imported `Dotbot.Core` from the retired `src/core/` path. Both are corrected, and the already-running branch calls a theme helper the dispatcher actually imports. The studio still needs its Vite build (`src/studio-ui/static/`, gitignored) to serve.
- **The dashboard no longer fetches webfonts from `fonts.googleapis.com` (#685).** `src/ui/static/css/base.css` `@import`ed Google Fonts, so a tool that otherwise runs entirely on localhost made an outbound request on every page load and silently fell back to system fonts offline. Inter and JetBrains Mono (both OFL-1.1) are now self-hosted as variable woff2 under `src/ui/static/fonts/` — latin and latin-ext subsets, matching the `unicode-range` splits the CDN stylesheet used, so accented text keeps its typeface — and the UI server serves `.woff2`/`.woff` with the correct MIME type.

- **Task merges no longer target a stale `base_branch`.** `Complete-TaskWorktree` took its integration
  target from the value `worktree-map.json` recorded when the worktree was created and never reconciled
  it with the branch the main checkout was on. With a clean tree it silently squash-merged the task into
  that recorded branch — usually the trunk — and reported plain success; with a dirty tracked file under
  `.bot/workspace/decisions/` it failed with `Failed to checkout <base> … (currently on: <branch>)` and
  parked the run. The target is now resolved by precedence: an explicit `-BaseBranch` from the caller (a
  workflow run passes its integration branch), then a configured `git.base_branch`, then the recorded
  value when it matches the checkout, then the checked-out branch — adopted, reconciled back into the
  map, and named in the result message. `task/*` branches and detached HEADs are never adopted.
- **The pre-merge stash no longer excludes `.bot/workspace/decisions/`.** That tree is tracked and is
  committed by the same function, but — unlike `.bot/workspace/tasks/` — it was never scrubbed or backed
  up, so a dirty file there blocked the very checkout the stash exists to enable.
- **The pre-merge stash is popped even when `git stash push` exits non-zero.** `git stash push -u` can
  stash successfully and still exit 1 over an advisory (`The following paths are ignored by one of your
  .gitignore files: .bot/workspace/tasks`), which made dotbot skip the pop and silently park the
  operator's uncommitted work in a stash. Stash detection now compares `refs/stash` before and after.
- **`Assert-OnBaseBranch` reports why a checkout failed and can honour `git.base_branch`.** It discarded
  git's stderr, so every blocker — a dirty tracked file, a branch held by another linked worktree, a
  file lock — produced the same unactionable message. It also had no `-BotRoot` parameter, so its
  no-`-BranchName` fallback could only ever resolve `main`/`master`; the three cleanup call sites in
  `Invoke-WorkflowProcess.ps1` used that fallback and yanked the working copy off a configured base
  branch on any failed or skipped task.
- **Creating a task worktree no longer ignores the project's own `.bot/` tree.** `Ensure-DotbotWorktreeExcludes` writes `.git/info/exclude`, which git keeps in the shared common directory, so its `.bot/workspace/tasks`, `.bot/content`, `.bot/hooks` and `.bot/settings` entries silently ignored those tracked trees in the operator's main checkout: `git add .bot/workspace/tasks/` became a no-op, workflow run state accumulated invisibly (`git status` stayed clean and `git clean -fd` could not remove it), and `FrameworkIntegrity`'s `git status` scan passed over three of its protected paths. Those entries are gone; suppression inside the worktree now uses a nested `.gitignore` in each generated copy, which cannot reach the main checkout. Already-affected repositories self-heal on their next task — the marker block is rewritten in place. (#681)
- **`Restore-DotbotTaskStateBackup` threw when recreating a task-state directory.** `New-Item -LiteralPath` is not a valid parameter; the call failed as soon as the task tree became visible to git again, surfacing as `failure_kind: exception` out of `Complete-TaskWorktree`.
- **`Complete-TaskWorktree` no longer discards a failed task-state staging.** The `git add` of `.bot/workspace/tasks/` and `.bot/workspace/decisions/` sent stderr to `$null` and never checked the exit code, so a refusal was invisible; it now logs a warning with git's output.
- **`dotbot run <workflow>` without `--watch` reported success for a run that could not progress (#682).** The runtime precondition and auto-start were both nested inside `if ($Watch)`, so the default path spawned the detached task-runner with no runtime and exited 0; the runner then parked every task in `needs-input` with `Dotbot runtime endpoint not available` — asynchronously, in a log file the caller never sees — after creating and pushing an integration branch. `--no-auto-runtime` was bound but unreachable without `--watch`.
- **`--poll-interval-ms` consumed the following token even when it was another flag**, so `dotbot run <wf> --poll-interval-ms --watch` cast `[int]"--watch"`, silently dropped `--watch`, and took the very detached path above. It now uses the same `-notmatch '^--?'` guard as the parser's `default` arm.

## [4.0.1] - 2026-07-02

### Added
- **`bootstrap.ps1`** at the repo root — the one-time install step. Drops the `bin/shim/dotbot*` PATH shim into `~/.local/bin` (Linux/macOS) or `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\WindowsApps` (Windows). Refuses PowerShell 5.1; never sets `$env:DOTBOT_HOME` for the user (design decision D4). Honours `-ShimDir` and `-Force`.
- **`dotbot status`** subcommand reporting resolved `DOTBOT_HOME`, framework branch + short SHA + dirty flag, version, user-settings path, and the active project's workflow / provider / stacks. `--json` emits a stable shape for CI scripts and the dashboard.
- **UI framework banner** in the dashboard header — surfaces the active `DOTBOT_HOME` plus framework branch/SHA/dirty, with an amber warning state when the checkout is dirty or off `main`/`master`.
- **`MIGRATING.md`** at the repo root walks v3 projects through the rewrite (shim install, project `.bot/` rewrite, `.mcp.json` repointing, user-settings move, settings layer reshuffle, retired-entry-point cheat sheet).
- **Active-stack hook chain** — `ContentResolver` now folds three tiers in order (framework → active stacks via `extends` chain in `.control/settings.json` → project), exposed via `Get-DotbotActiveStackChain`.

### Changed
- **`dotbot init` is now a sparse project bootstrap.** A fresh `.bot/` contains only `workspace/` (seeded from `<DOTBOT_HOME>/content/workspace-template/`) and `.gitignore`. Framework content stays in `$env:DOTBOT_HOME` and is resolved lazily; `-Workflow X` / `-Stack Y` materialise project-tier directories under `.bot/content/` only when the source ships an `overrides/` subtree (registry items always materialise). Init hard-errors when `DOTBOT_HOME` is unset.
- **`Get-MergedSettings` Layer 1 source moved** from `<BotRoot>/settings/settings.default.json` (which init no longer creates) to `<DOTBOT_HOME>/content/settings/settings.default.json`. A new tracked project override layer at `<BotRoot>/content/settings/settings.default.json` sits between framework defaults and user-settings.
- **Workspace `instance_id` moved** out of `settings.default.json` into `.bot/.control/settings.json`, lazy-created by the runtime on first start. UI writers already wrote to `.control/settings.json`, so no operator action is required for existing projects.
- **`workflow add` / `workflow remove`** record / clear the active workflow in `.bot/.control/settings.json`. No more `installed_workflows` baseline writes, `.mcp.json` merges, `.env.local` scaffolding, or `domain.task_categories` merges into the framework defaults file.
- **CLI scripts (`runtime-start`, `runtime-status`, `tasks-run`, `workflow-list`, `workflow-run`, `workflow-scaffold`)** import runtime modules from `<DOTBOT_HOME>/src/runtime/Modules/` directly. The old walk-up-to-find-a-fallback path is gone.
- **MCP server discovery** walks both `tools/` (new layout) and `systems/mcp/tools/` (legacy) under each workflow source — the pre-v4 init normalised the latter to the former on copy, and the resolver now handles it directly.
- **README, AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md** rewritten for the shim-only install model. Quick Start is `git clone` + `pwsh bootstrap.ps1` + `$env:DOTBOT_HOME = $PWD`. AGENTS.md "Dev Cycle" drops the reinstall step (DOTBOT_HOME tracks the checkout live). Architecture sections describe the layered content resolver and four-layer settings chain.

### Removed
- **`install.ps1`, `install-remote.ps1`** — the copy-based installers. v4 only ships a PATH shim; the framework is a git checkout you point `$env:DOTBOT_HOME` at.
- **`dotbot.psm1`, `dotbot.psd1`** — the PowerShell Gallery entry point. `Install-Module Dotbot` retired alongside `install.ps1`.
- **`src/cli/install-global.ps1`** — the deploy-to-`~/dotbot` logic that the retired installers called.
- **`src/init.ps1`, `src/go.ps1`** — IDE-integration setup and UI launcher copies that `dotbot init` used to drop into `.bot/`. Their replacement is the `dotbot runtime-start` subcommand backed by `src/cli/runtime-start.ps1`.
- **`tests/Test-GoScript.ps1`** — its end-to-end launch test was already skipped pending the `dotbot go` rehoming.
- **`.bot/.manifest.json` generation + pre-commit hook generation + framework-paths protection** — Phase 4 removed the framework copy from `.bot/`, so the integrity gates that guarded those copies became inert.
- **`.bot/src/`, `.bot/content/`, `.bot/settings/`, `.bot/recipes/`, `.bot/hooks/`** copies. They were caches of framework code that drifted; the runtime resolver now reads them lazily from `DOTBOT_HOME`.
- **`.codex/config.toml`, `.gemini/settings.json`** writes from `dotbot init`. Provider MCP configuration is the user's to manage; the `dotbot mcp link` subcommand to wire it up automatically is on the roadmap (Phase 8 in `PLAN.md`).
- **`Install-Module Dotbot` / `irm install-remote.ps1 | iex` / `pwsh install.ps1` / `dotbot update` / `.bot\go.ps1` / `.bot\init.ps1`** as entry points. See `MIGRATING.md` §7 for the cheat-sheet.
- **`docs/whitepapers/UI-AND-DOMAIN-MODEL-WHITEPAPER-v2.md`** — described the v3 launcher (`.bot\go.ps1`) and is fully superseded by `MIGRATING.md` plus the rewritten README/AGENTS.md.

### Migration
- Existing v3 projects need the rewrite documented in `MIGRATING.md`: archive `~/dotbot`, clone afresh, run `bootstrap.ps1`, set `DOTBOT_HOME`, then `git rm` the stale `.bot/src` + `.bot/content` + `.bot/settings` + `.bot/recipes` + `.bot/hooks` + `.bot/.manifest.json` + `.bot/go.ps1` + `.bot/init.ps1` per project. The `~/dotbot/user-settings.json → ~/.config/dotbot/user-settings.json` move is automatic (idempotent migration on first `Get-MergedSettings` call).

### CI
- **Release pipeline rewired to the shim-only model.** `test.json` drops the `pwsh install.ps1` step from all jobs; `release.json` builds the archive by `rsync`-ing the working tree (sans `.git/`, `node_modules/`, `.bot/`, staging + archive outputs), overlays the pre-built `src/studio-ui/static/`, and uploads the GitHub release with v4 install commands in the notes. The PSGallery publish job is deleted. `bump-release.json` drops the `dotbot.psd1` `ModuleVersion` bump — `version.json` is the only bump artefact now.
- **Theme-hygiene scanner** now targets `bootstrap.ps1` instead of the retired `install.ps1`; `src/cli/Platform-Functions.psm1` is the sole exempt file.
- Layer 1 has a new BOOTSTRAP.PS1 contract block that drives `bootstrap.ps1` into a temp `-ShimDir` and asserts the PS 7 guard, shim source, platform default targets, and the "never `SetEnvironmentVariable(...DOTBOT_HOME...)`" rule (D4).
- Layer 2 has a new "Phase 4: dotbot init footprint" block pinning the strict init contract (`.bot/` children == `{.gitignore, workspace}`; nothing outside `.bot/` mutated; project tier created only when overrides exist) and a "Phase 5: `dotbot status --json` shape" block pinning the JSON contract that the UI banner + CI scripts depend on.

### Kickstart vocabulary rename (previously documented)
- The kickstart vocabulary rename is locked in across the codebase. CSS classes, JS function names, modal IDs, the `kickstart_*` keys on `/api/info` (now `workflow_*`), the `Get-KickstartStatus` PowerShell function (now `Get-WorkflowStatus`), workflow JSON commit-message templates (`chore(kickstart):` → `chore(workflow):`), and the `dotbot-kickstart` generator string in `task-groups.json` and `roadmap-overview.md` front matter (now `dotbot-task-runner`) all use the new names.
- User-visible: the project-launch button label changed from `KICKSTART PROJECT` to `LAUNCH PROJECT`. The `Kickstart` button text in the preflight modal changed to `Launch`. The Jira interview phase title changed from `Kickstart Interview (Multi-Repo)` to `Project Interview (Multi-Repo)`. New commit messages use `chore(workflow):` instead of `chore(kickstart):`.
- The `kickstart-via-jira`, `kickstart-via-pr`, `kickstart-via-repo`, and `kickstart-from-scratch` workflow aliases in `dotbot init -Workflow` are gone. Use the canonical `start-from-jira`, `start-from-pr`, `start-from-repo`, and `start-from-prompt` names.
- The `tests/Test-NoKickstartReferences.ps1` warning gate is now `tests/Test-NoLegacyVocabulary.ps1`, a hard Layer 1 fail. Any `kickstart` reference outside `ideas/` and the gate file itself fails the build.
